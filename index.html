    <h1>Privacy Policy for King James Bible</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: August 21, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>JoshTechApps ("we," "us," or "our") develops King James Bible ("the App"), a free, ad-supported application providing daily Bible verses, prayers, quizzes, and customization features. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data</strong>: We use Google AdMob to display ads (e.g., Interstitial, Native Advanced, Rewarded). AdMob may collect device identifiers such as Advertising ID, IP address, device type, and usage data to serve personalized ads, as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: We store notes, favorite verses, and quiz progress locally on your device using Room persistence. This data is not transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: If you enable notifications in the App’s settings, we use device permissions to schedule daily reminders for verses and prayers at 08:00 and 21:00.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect personal details such as your name, email, or location unless you voluntarily provide them (e.g., via email contact).</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics Data</strong>: We do not use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user behavior in the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data</strong>: AdMob uses collected data to deliver relevant ads and improve ad performance. We do not directly access or control this data.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: We use locally stored data to provide features such as saving notes, marking favorite verses, and tracking quiz progress within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: We use notification permissions to deliver scheduled reminders if you opt in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your local data or notification preferences with any third parties. AdMob may share device identifiers with its advertising partners (e.g., ad networks) to serve ads, as outlined in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>. We do not use other third-party SDKs that collect data.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the following options regarding your data:
        <ul>
            <li>Opt out of personalized ads by resetting your Advertising ID or disabling personalized ads in your device’s settings (e.g., Android Settings > Google > Ads) or through the App’s ad consent form (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Disable notifications in the App’s settings or your device’s notification settings.</li>
            <li>Delete local data by clearing the App’s data through your device’s settings or uninstalling the App.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain local data (notes, favorite verses, quiz progress) on your device until you clear the App’s data or uninstall it. We do not store any personal data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The King James Bible App is rated E for Everyone and is not directed at children under the age of 13, in compliance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect, use, or share personal information from children under 13, including device identifiers like Advertising ID used by Google AdMob for ads.</p>
    <p>For users in the European Union, where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may apply an age threshold of 16 for certain data processing, we similarly do not knowingly collect personal information from users under 16 without appropriate consent. Since the App stores user data (e.g., notes, favorite verses, quiz progress) locally on your device and does not transmit it to our servers, no personal information is collected directly by us.</p>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to serve ads, and we configure AdMob to comply with COPPA and GDPR by defaulting to non-personalized ads where required by law for younger users. If we become aware that a child under 13 (or under 16 in applicable regions) has provided personal information, we will take steps to delete such data immediately, including coordinating with AdMob if necessary. If you believe a child’s data has been collected, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contactjoshtech@gmail.com">contactjoshtech@gmail.com</a>, and we will address your concern promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on Android’s built-in security features, such as app sandboxing, to protect local data stored on your device. Since no data is transmitted to our servers, there is no risk of server-side data breaches.</p>

    <h2>8. International Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union (GDPR), California (CCPA), or other regions with data protection laws, you may have additional rights, such as requesting access to or deletion of your data. Since we only store data locally and use AdMob for ads, you can exercise these rights through your device settings or Google’s ad settings. Contact us at <a href="mailto:contactjoshtech@gmail.com">contactjoshtech@gmail.com</a> for assistance.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post the updated policy on this page, and your continued use of the App constitutes consent to those changes.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contactjoshtech@gmail.com">contactjoshtech@gmail.com</a>.</p>
